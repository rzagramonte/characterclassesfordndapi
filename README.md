# D&D Character Classes API
This project is a Node.js and Express-based API that provides information about Dungeons & Dragons character classes. It includes various classes, each with distinct attributes such as description, house, color, focus, and sense. The API is accessible through endpoints, and a simple HTML page serves as documentation, listing available classes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, HTML, JavaScript

This project is a simple API built using Node.js and Express to provide information about Dungeons & Dragons character classes. The API has various character classes, each with a set of attributes such as description, house, color, focus, and sense. The HTML page provides a list of available classes and serves as documentation for the API.

## Optimizations

Future optimizations for this project will include adding more details and attributes to each character class, expanding the API to include additional endpoints, or implementing authentication for specific classes.

## Lessons Learned:

Through building this API, I gained hands-on experience with creating a basic web server using Node.js and Express. I also improved my understanding of routing and handling requests. Additionally, this project allowed me to practice sending and receiving data between the server and client.
